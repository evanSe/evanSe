👋 Hi, I'm **Evan Seaward**! I'm a Software Engineer from Australia, now living in the beautiful city of Wrocław, Poland. I’m passionate about building AI-first applications that push the boundaries of technology and exploring the unknown.

Originally from Australia and now based in Poland, I’ve worked on a variety of exciting projects, from web applications to developer tools. I've also had the privilege of speaking at conferences like JS Nation in Amsterdam, sharing my thoughts on the future of AI (and life, the universe, and everything 🪐).

Check out my repositories to see what I’ve been working on lately—**don't panic**, it's all here! 🌌

✈️ Just keep swimming 🌏
