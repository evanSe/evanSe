👋 Hi, I'm Evan Seaward! I'm a Software Engineer from Australia, now living in the beautiful city of Wrocław, Poland. I’m passionate about building AI-first applications that push the boundaries of what's possible in technology.

Originally from Australia and now based in Poland, I’ve worked on a variety of exciting projects, from web applications to developer tools. I’ve also had the privilege of speaking at conferences like JS Nation in Amsterdam, sharing my insights on AI-first solutions.
